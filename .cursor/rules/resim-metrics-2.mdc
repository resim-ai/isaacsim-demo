## Overview
ReSim Metrics 2.0 is an exciting new feature that allows you to emit and dynamically query metrics from your system.
Metrics are emitted as JSON objects and stored in an `emissions.ndjson` file.
Topics and metrics are defined in the `.resim/metrics/config.yml` file.

## Topics
Topics define the data that is emitted from your system. They may contain a timestamp.
Items in the schema can have the following types:
- float
- string
- int
- image
- status
- string[]
- metric[]

Here are some example topics:
```
topics:
  time_to_goal:
    schema:
      time_s: float
      goal_name: string
  pose_difference:
    schema:
      position_diff_m: float
```

## Event topics
Event topics are marked by having the `event: true` field in the config.yml file.
The event topic always must have a schema like this:
```
schema:
name: string
description: string
status: status
tags: string[]
```
The status field is one of the following:
- PASSED
- FAIL_WARN
- FAIL_BLOCK
- NO_STATUS_REPORTED

## Metrics

Metrics are how we consume the data from the topics. Their primary components are a query and a template.
Here is an example of a metric:
```
metrics:
  Localization Error:
    type: test
    description: Difference in position between odometry and AMCL localization poses over time.
    query_string: SELECT 'Error', timestamp / 1E9 AS "Time (s)", position_diff_m as "Position Difference (m)" FROM pose_difference
    template_type: system
    template: line
```
The `query_string` is a SQL query in the Athena dialect. The template defines how the plot is rendered.
The `system` `line` and `bar` charts expect the query to return 3 columns: `group_name`, `x`, `y`. Hence, to display multiple series in the chart, you need an emissions with different `group_name`s. The names of the columns can be anything, but they must be in the order of `group_name`, `x`, `y`.
The `system` `scalar` chart expects the query to return 1 column: `value`.
